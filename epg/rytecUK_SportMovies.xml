The police and FBI launch a nationwide manhunt, but are thwarted at every turn by the killer's enigmatic, and unprecedented behaviour. Despite her lack of experience, Eleanor is drawn deeper into the case as she, and her newfound mentor, realise that she may be the only person, given her own tortured psyche, who can understand the mind of this singular killer.
