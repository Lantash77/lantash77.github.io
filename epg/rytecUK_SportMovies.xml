  <desc lang="en">Eternally cool director Richard Linklater's "spiritual sequel" to 1993's slacker hit Dazed and Confused follows a house full of baseball jocks as they spend some quality party time together before the start of the 1980 college year. Over four wonderfully wasted days, freshman Jake (Blake Jenner) bonds with his new teammates over bongs, babes, beer and batting practice... all to some of the finest tracks ever to grace a cassette player. A chilled-out comedy with a warm, nostalgic buzz - if they could bottle Friday night, it'd taste like this
